                <h2>executive summary</h2>
                <p>As a Product Designer, I researched travel applications and created WDTRAV aimed to fill in a market gap.  While there are several travel applications currently on the market, WDTRAV allows users to compare, book, research and split costs when traveling in a group all within one application.  Research, brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping and testing were conducted to develop a mid fidelity prototype. </p>

                    <dd class="col-sm-9">WDTRAV has combined the planning and experience all into one app from start to finish. The travel application allows the user to search, price compare and book travels with the ability to split the final travel cost with friends directly from the application.  The application is geared more towards locally owned hotels and attractions, all reviewed by the local community and previous travelers.  The design started by researching the market, interviewing users, developing personas, brainstorming, prioritizing, creating prototypes and testing with several iterations in between. </dd>

                        <p>In order to understand my users I developed a research plan along side 2 other UX Designers.  The initial piece was to develop three user-centric objectives: Understand how users travelling has been affected by the pandemic, past travel experiences and new travel habits.  With my objectives identified I developed quantitative and qualitative questions for a total of 25 questions.  I held 4 private virtual interviews and included 3 additional interviews the team interviewed.  After interviews were completed all responses were analyzed and simplified in groups with common responses, goals and needs using Miro.  </p>

I began brainstorming what users like, wish and what if opportunities when traveling, learning new cultures and booking new travels.  I highlighted the comments which would be feasible, liable and user-centric to carry over into a prioritization chart.  The prioritization chart ranks  each comment based on impact and complexity. </p>

The storyboard is a key element prior to prototyping as it captures process, actions, user emotions from beginning to end. It allowed me to put myself at the beginning of wanting to travel and walks me through the booking process, researching local attractions and concluding with submitting reviews.  Each portion of the process is shown with a picture, description and possible emotion the user may feel.  Emotions are color coded with green being positive emotion and red being a negative emotion.  </p>

                <h2>prototype wireframes</h2>
                <p>I spent 2.5 hrs working through the flow and sketching the process into low-fidelity hand sketches.  As you can see there are some instances where I inserted certain screens in order to have a smooth transition between tasks. After sketching 34 screens, I used InVision to assist in creating a Low-Fi InVision prototype.  I conducted a couple of small interviews which provided me some insights on missing screens.  During the next step of digitizing my wireframes I added a few screens to capture comments.  I included a screen where the user could select the type of booking, added a calendar screen for departure and return, the number of passengers between adults and kids, and after seat selection I provided the user with more options for their next steps.  I digitized my screens using Figma.  You may visit my prototypes at:</p>

                            After creating an initial digital prototype, I worked on the interface design to create a more bright and user friendly design.  The design included creating patterns, rounding button corners and adding shadows to indicate which buttons are to be pushed.

                        <p>WDTRAV started as an application for solo and group travelers in booking and customizing their trips during their trip and achieved it's goal.  We aimed to answer:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            How might we improve WDTRAV so that the users can engage local culture, understand user feedback, and booking based on previous users’ reviews ? 
                            <br>
                            The application allows users to research, compare, split and find recommendations on their trips.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The value of guerilla testing on a prototype is priceless because the user has an actual system rather than a theory. After our application I learned users travel with groups often, are budget conscious, want to be involved the new cultures and value recommendations.   The application I started provided these features but needed feedback from our users apart from the initial boost of interviews.  Users want to be effective in the design and do not want added steps.  Users prefer pop features rather than a separate screen.
